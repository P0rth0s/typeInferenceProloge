Changes
=====================================

Added multiplaction for integers and floats, added division for floats.

Added Boolean type.
Also added many fType built in functions such as greater than, less than etc.

Added if statements.

Added for loops. Iter and var must be same type

Added local variables that are deleted after code in IN argument runs - Delete is broken.

Linked typeExp and typeCode so that blocks of exp could be passed into functions and return last type in list.
This was neccessary for for loops since TypeExpList returns a curried version.

Made it so typeCode could be ([S], T) or ([[S]], T). This represents having multiple blocks of code.
Ie. (code block) ;; (code block) - as requested in readme todo list
